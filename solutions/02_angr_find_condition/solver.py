# It is very useful to be able to search for a state that reaches a certain
# instruction. However, in some cases, you may not know the address of the
# specific instruction you want to reach (or perhaps there is no single
# instruction goal.) In this challenge, you don't know which instruction
# grants you success. Instead, you just know that you want to find a state where
# the binary prints "Good Job."
#
# Angr is powerful in that it allows you to search for a states that meets an
# arbitrary condition that you specify in Python, using a predicate you define
# as a function that takes a state and returns True if you have found what you
# are looking for, and False otherwise.

  # Same as above, but this time check if the state should abort. If you return
  # False, Angr will continue to step the state. In this specific challenge, the
  # only time at which you will know you should abort is when the program prints
  # "Try again."
