# This challenge could, in theory, be solved in multiple ways. However, for the
# sake of learning how to simulate an alternate filesystem, please solve this
# challenge according to structure provided below. As a challenge, once you have
# an initial solution, try solving this in an alternate way.
#
# Problem description and general solution strategy:
# The binary loads the password from a file using the fread function. If the
# password is correct, it prints "Good Job." In order to keep consistency with
# the other challenges, the input from the console is written to a file in the 
# ignore_me function. As the name suggests, ignore it, as it only exists to
# maintain consistency with other challenges.
# We want to:
# 1. Determine the file from which fread reads.
# 2. Use Angr to simulate a filesystem where that file is replaced with our own
#    simulated file.
# 3. Initialize the file with a symbolic value, which will be read with fread
#    and propogated through the program.
# 4. Solve for the symbolic input to determine the password.

  start_address = 0x80488db
  initial_state = project.factory.blank_state(addr=start_address)

  # Specify some information needed to construct a simulated file. For this
  # challenge, the filename is hardcoded, but in theory, it could be symbolic. 
  # Note: to read from the file, the binary calls
  # 'fread(buffer, sizeof(char), 64, file)'.
  # (!)
  filename = 'WCEXPXBW.txt'  # :string
  symbolic_file_size_bytes = 64

  # Construct a bitvector for the password and then store it in the file's
  # backing memory. For example, imagine a simple file, 'hello.txt':
  #
  # Hello world, my name is John.
  # ^                       ^
  # ^ address 0             ^ address 24 (count the number of characters)
  # In order to represent this in memory, we would want to write the string to
  # the beginning of the file:
  #
  # hello_txt_contents = claripy.BVV('Hello world, my name is John.', 30*8)
  #
  # Perhaps, then, we would want to replace John with a
  # symbolic variable. We would call:
  #
  # name_bitvector = claripy.BVS('symbolic_name', 4*8)
  #
  # Then, after the program calls fopen('hello.txt', 'r') and then
  # fread(buffer, sizeof(char), 30, hello_txt_file), the buffer would contain
  # the string from the file, except four symbolic bytes where the name would be
  # stored.
  # (!)
  password = claripy.BVS('password', symbolic_file_size_bytes * 8)

  # Construct the symbolic file. The file_options parameter specifies the Linux
  # file permissions (read, read/write, execute etc.) The content parameter
  # specifies from where the stream of data should be supplied. If content is
  # an instance of SimSymbolicMemory (we constructed one above), the stream will
  # contain the contents (including any symbolic contents) of the memory,
  # beginning from address zero.
  # Set the content parameter to our BVS instance that holds the symbolic data.
  # (!)
  password_file = angr.storage.SimFile(filename, content=password)
  
  # Add the symbolic file we created to the symbolic filesystem.
