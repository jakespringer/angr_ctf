# Before you begin, here are a few notes about these capture-the-flag
# challenges.
#
# Each binary, when run, will ask for a password, which can be entered via stdin
# (typing it into the console.) Many of the levels will accept many different
# passwords. Your goal is to find a single password that works for each binary.
#
# If you enter an incorrect password, the program will print "Try again." If you
# enter a correct password, the program will print "Good Job."
#
# Each challenge will be accompanied by a file like this one, named
# "scaffoldXX.py". It will offer guidance as well as the skeleton of a possible
# solution. You will have to edit each file. In some cases, you will have to
# edit it significantly. While use of these files is recommended, you can write
# a solution without them, if you find that they are too restrictive.
#
# Places in the scaffoldXX.py that require a simple substitution will be marked
# with three question marks (???). Places that require more code will be marked
# with an ellipsis (...). Comments will document any new concepts, but will be
# omitted for concepts that have already been covered (you will need to use
# previous scaffoldXX.py files as a reference to solve the challenges.) If a
# comment documents a part of the code that needs to be changed, it will be
# marked with an exclamation point at the end, on a separate line (!).
