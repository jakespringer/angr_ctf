# This level performs the following computations:
#
# 1. Get 16 bytes of user input and encrypt it.
# 2. Save the result of check_equals_AABBCCDDEEFFGGHH (or similar)
# 3. Get another 16 bytes from the user and encrypt it.
# 4. Check that it's equal to a predefined password.
#
# The ONLY part of this program that we have to worry about is #2. We will be
# replacing the call to check_equals_ with our own version, using a hook, since
# check_equals_ will run too slowly otherwise.
