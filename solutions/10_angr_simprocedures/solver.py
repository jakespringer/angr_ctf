# This challenge is similar to the previous one. It operates under the same
# premise that you will have to replace the check_equals_ function. In this 
# case, however, check_equals_ is called so many times that it wouldn't make 
# sense to hook where each one was called. Instead, use a SimProcedure to write
# your own check_equals_ implementation and then hook the check_equals_ symbol 
# to replace all calls to scanf with a call to your SimProcedure.

    # treat a native function in the binary returning. An example:
